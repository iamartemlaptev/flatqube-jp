# How to get EVER

Here are 3 ways to get EVER on your wallet.

* You can purchase EVER on exchanges where it is available and then withdraw them to your EVER Wallet address:

* The second way is to [transfer your tokens from another network](https://app.gitbook.com/s/YHWioUoTfRHYtNnL7rgu/bridge/cross-chain-transfer/how-to/transferring-from-another-network-to-everscale) (Ethereum, BNB, Fantom Opera and Polygon) to Everscale using the Octus Bridge cross-chain transfer interface.\
  At the stage of choosing a token and amount to transfer you can convert a part of sent tokens into a EVER to pay a commission for this transfer and subsequent wallet deployment.
* The last way is to buy EVER or WEVER [directly on FlatQube](https://flatqube.io/swap/0:a519f99bb5d6d51ef958ed24d337ad75a1c770885dcd42d51d6663f9fcdacfb2/0:a49cd4e158a9a15555e624759e2e4e766d22600b7800d891e46f9291f044a93d).​

To make a swap on FlatQube you need a [deployed wallet](https://app.gitbook.com/s/vwtaQbYcgICT7ubKSITZ/getting-started/install-and-singing-in/deploy)!
